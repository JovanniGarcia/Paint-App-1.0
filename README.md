want to laugh? my first app i created. it was a fun learning experience.
# Introduction

What I have created is a **simple Painting application** that allows the user to practice drawing with the use of a mouse. With the advancement of technology, people have become more adept at using PCs for everything as well as expressing their creative side. Although some may not be as skilled with an actual paintbrush, this application allows the user to challenge their creativity using a mouse.

## Program Interface

The users will have an easy experience when it comes to starting the app. Just click on the EXE file, and the user can start painting immediately. A canvas along with different tools will appear on the GUI at the user’s disposal. To exit the program, the user can click on the "X" at the top right-hand corner or click on “File” and then “Exit” on the menu strip.

## Program Execution

The application, as aforementioned, is very simple to use. It mainly consists of a canvas, a toolbox section, and a menu strip. The toolbox contains the following:

- Paint brush color
- Paint brush size
- Canvas color
- Shape buttons (Circle, Rectangle, Square)
- Shape size

The only input the user may need to adjust is the shape size and the brush size. The menu strip contains a "File" option which allows the user to clear the canvas of any paintings using the “Clear” button, and an “Exit” button which closes the application.

## Input and Output

The only input the user may need to adjust is the shape size and the brush size. This changes how big you want the shapes you place on the canvas and how big you want the strokes with the brush. If the user inputs 500 as the shape size, the placed shape would take a substantial amount of space on the canvas.
